# Hi there
I develop software solutions for enterprise-level companies and small businesses alike.
Whether your project is a brand new startup or an established corporation, I’ll love working with you to help make your ideas & vision a reality.
I am here to be a complete technology partner for your project. I am an expert in the whole process – everything from idealization, design, and prototyping, to internet-scale rollout.
I work in the kind of sprint cycles where the deliverable is measured, and feedback from the client is often.
I believe in continuous delivery – deploy code often.
